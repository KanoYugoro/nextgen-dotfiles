# Matt Smith's Dotfiles

My original dotfiles came from a fork of a colleague of mine. I've learned a
lot since that time, and now it's time to start again from scratch with my own
personal quirks completely throughout the repo. Here's to another fun ride!

## Mac Requirements

- XCode command line tools
- homebrew
- `brew install vim`
- `brew install ctags`  // I still need to configure this again
- p4merge
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- powerline fonts
- tmux // Isn't there a brew install for this?
- `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace` for tmux
- `brew install the_silver_searcher`
- `brew install git`
